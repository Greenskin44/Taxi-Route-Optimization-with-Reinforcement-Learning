# Taxi Route Optimization with Reinforcement Learning

**Educational Disclaimer:** This project is created for educational purposes only and was inspired by DataCamp's reinforcement learning curriculum. It demonstrates the application of Q-learning algorithms in solving route optimization problems.

## Overview

This project implements a Q-learning algorithm to train a taxi agent for optimal route planning in a simulated urban environment. The agent learns to efficiently pick up and drop off passengers while minimizing travel time and maximizing rewards.

- **Reward Structure**: +20 for successful delivery, -10 for illegal actions, -1 per step

### Algorithm
- **Method**: Q-learning (model-free reinforcement learning)
- **Exploration**: Œµ-greedy strategy with decay
- **Learning**: Bellman equation for Q-value updates
- **Policy**: Greedy action selection from learned Q-table
