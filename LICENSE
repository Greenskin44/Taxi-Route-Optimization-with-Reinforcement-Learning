EDUCATIONAL DISCLAIMER:

This project is created for educational purposes only and was inspired by 
DataCamp's reinforcement learning curriculum. It is intended to demonstrate 
the application of Q-learning algorithms in solving route optimization problems.

The implementation prioritizes clarity and educational value over production 
optimization. Users should adapt and extend the code for real-world applications
with appropriate considerations for performance, security, and scalability.

This project utilizes:
- OpenAI Gymnasium (Taxi-v3 environment)
- Educational concepts from DataCamp
- Standard reinforcement learning algorithms

For educational use, research, and learning purposes.
